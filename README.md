# ðŸ“– tarbus-poc - Softarea internship project (Abandoned)
## The development of this application has been abandoned. I am currently working on a new version of it, where I am trying to implement it more object-oriented using the RxJava library, RxAndroid

The tarbus-poc application was developed as part of an internship at SOFTAREA. It shows the actual departure times of buses from a bus stop, using the api of TarnÃ³w Public Transport. In addition, we can check the timetable for a given bus stop and a given line offline, display a list of the nearest bus stops and search for a bus connection online.
